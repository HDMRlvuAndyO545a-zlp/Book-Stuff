# About
I'm using this as a way to organize my thoughts on a book I'm reading: "*1984*." by George Orwell (also known as Eric Arthur Blair).
Doing this mostly because I'm currently reading this for English and it'd be nice to get my thoughts in order. With that in mind I'll need
to look at 

1. The story so far
2. What we (I) know about the setting
3. The context of when the story was *initially* written
4. And the writing style, because as someone who writes has a hobby the amount of detail said speaks volumes.

Not in that particular order of course, I'm writing this as I go. Anyway, I guess a good place to start would be

**The Context!**

...because from his point of veiw 1984 was the future, and everyome had weird ideas for the future. 
## Context
Time for a crash course in everything you need to know about the man:
- Had a few run-ins with the Soviets
- Not a fan of the Nazis
- Died before 1984, his book was a cautionary tale so people don't let it happen

And that's about it. You really don't need to know much about him to understand the story, and even if yyou had no idea who he was it is still possible to understand why it was written, which I find very nice.
